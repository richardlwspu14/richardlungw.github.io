# BASKET

This was a final project for the CSC4151/4152 course. Developed in React Native JavaScript and Expo. 

## Project Details
This was a final group project for the CCSC4151/4152 Software Engineering course. My group consisted of 4 members, myself, Daniela Castro, Nicholas Sutanto, and Pravitha Pratheep. My role as the ScrumMaster was to ensure that the progress was running smoothly and accordingly with the timeline. I was also responsible for the back-end coding for this project. 

BASKET is a grocery delivery application mainly to serve all stakeholders around King County, WA. The application will provide functionalities like searching up for stores nearby, looking up items, ordering and delivery. During such trying times, local stores are struggling to survive and make ends meet. Unlike most grocery delivery applications that only covers chain grocery stores, BASKET provides a platform for “mom and pop” stores and other grocery stores that are not covered by competing delivery applications.

_On this page, the user can confirm their delivery address and phone number. Once the user inputs their delivery address, they can press 'View' to view the route between the store and the delivery address. The map's interface uses a React Native maps plugin, while the search for the delivery address uses the Bing Map API._
