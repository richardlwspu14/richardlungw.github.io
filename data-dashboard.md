# Data Dashboard

## Internship Background
The internship as a Web Developer was conducted at PT. HK Metals Utama Tbk, a local aluminum manufacturing company located in Jakarta, Indonesia. The internship started on July 1, 2020, and ended on August 16, 2020. 

## Assignment Details
As a Web Developer intern at PT. HK Metals Utama Tbk, I was assigned to develop a web-based data dashboard which displays up-to-date data of accounts receivable and sales. The company uses XAMPP to develop its web applications and phpMyAdmin to store and upload the database. Thus, I used these two programs to develop the data dashboard and Visual Studio Code as my IDE.
