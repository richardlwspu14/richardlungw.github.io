# Text Analysis

## Goal
The assignment is to create a software application with the Qt program application. 

## Project Details
This was a final group project for the CSC3220 Applications Programming course. My group consisted of 2 members, myself and my teammate, Pravitha. I was responsible for the coding and quality control and Pravitha was responsible for the UI/UX design. 

We came up with an idea of a laundry app guide. All clothing and linens have certain conditions when they are to be washed, and so this app provides the guide to correctly wash specific laundry. Users are able to choose the symbols based on the clothing and/or linen they wish to wash, and the app will provide instructions on how to wash them. A built-in timer is also available in the application. 

## Project Outcome

The starting page of our application. The top button will allow users to access the app's services, while the button at the bottom will allow the users to access the timer.

This is where the users are able to choose the logos based on their clothing/linen tag symbols. The 5 tabs indicate the type of washing (i.e. "Wash", "Bleach", "Dry", "Iron", "Dry Clean"). Users can then proceed to the next page by clicking the button at the bottom right.
