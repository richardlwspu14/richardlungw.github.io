# Dashboard UI
## Goal: 
The assignment is to create a multi-functional home/office dashboard app with Qt Creator. 

## Project Details:
Copied from the instructor's instructions:
There is a growing interest about home/office assistants and dashboard apps. Recently, Google Home Hub and Amazon Echo Show hit the market, and they provide a brief information on their screen including the current time, temperature, weather, as well as traffic condition, etc.

In this lab assignment, you are supposed to build a multi-functional dashboard application for home or office use. Your app is expected to be large enough to cover entire screen, just like a screen saver.

In this assignment, I teamed up with my classmate, Pravitha. I was mainly responsible for the coding and quality control, and she was mainly responsible for the UI/UX Design. 

## Project Outcome:
<img src="images/Dashboard ui.png?raw=true"/>
_Starting from the top left corner, a digital clock is displayed with a light red background. Two mini screen savers containing different quotes and images are displayed under the clock. On the right half of the dashboard the user can enter a desired ZIP code on the input text and once the "Update" button is clicked, both the Weather and the Map features will change according to the ZIP code that has been inputted. On the bottom left corner, a world digital clock is displayed. In this case, we chose Malaysia as the world clock._
